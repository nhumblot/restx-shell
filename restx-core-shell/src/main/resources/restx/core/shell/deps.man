## deps install

Resolve the dependencies declared in the file `md.restx.json`, and synchronize them in `target/dependency` directory.

This command uses Apache Ivy under the hood to perform dependency resolution, using settings provided by restx.

You can override these Ivy settings by placing a file named ivysettings.xml in your restx shell install location
(usually `~/.restx`).

Note: You need to be placed in a restx app root directory to run this command.
